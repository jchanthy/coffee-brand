            <p>
              The year was 1980 when WakeCup was imagined after experiencing
              some of the finest coffees on an educational trip to Brazil and
              the South Americas. We wanted to break the monotony of low
              profile, non-descript coffee that was doing rounds in those
              cafeterias of the 80s. But life threw us in a different direction,
              and we ended up in the tech industry with a desire to get into the
              world of coffee someday.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2005, that dream was brought to fruition when we quit our jobs
              and started WakeCup. Ever since then, we’ve gone around the world
              in search for the best beans and we couldn’t be happier. We love
              spreading smiles through our coffee. Our quest has taken us around
              the world to some of the finest plantations and estates, many of
              whom work with us directly or indirectly.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2016 we started conducting workshops and became the primary
              sponsors of the Bean King Champion contest. Our baristas have won
              global accolades and we love serving cuppa goodness.
