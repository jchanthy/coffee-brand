              Our commitment to you is that we source our coffee beans from the
              finest estates and plantations from around the world. Our team
              visits these plantations to assess and determine the quality of
              coffee before it makes it to our shortlist. Which is why we have a
              really short list, because to us, only the best matter. We also
              ensure the farms we work with are free from slave labour and any
              other malpractice and are ecologically responsible and follow
              ethical practices.

              <p>
                We came across Lima Gold Plantations by chance during our visit
                to Ethiopia in 2018. Ever since then, we’ve been mesmerized by
                the blends from this amazing estate. And your love for unique
                blends from this plantation makes our association strong.

              <h2>Attaca Estate, Brazil</h2>
              <p>
                This popular estate was the subject of intrigue after a number
                of UFO videos emerged from the region in 2008. We’re sure the
                UFOs were there for the amazing Arabica that they cultivate over
                there. And we agree. Attaca produces some of the finest coffee
                and we’ve got them all to prove our point.

              <h2>Vardha Plantations, India</h2>
              <p>
                Our coffee hunt in South India sprung up a surprise in 2019 when
                we came across Mr. Rajamani Vardha who’s great grandfather
                established Vardha Plantations in Karnataka, India in the late
                1800s on orders of a British general who wanted great coffee.
                More than a century later, Vardha Plantations still produce
                their uniquely amazing blend that has come to be a crowd
                favourite with us.
